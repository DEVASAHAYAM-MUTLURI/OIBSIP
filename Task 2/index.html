            <b> &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Mother Teresa</b> (26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997) <br> 
            &ensp; Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu, MC better known as Mother Teresa, was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun and the founder of the Missionaries of Charity. She was 
            born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu in Skopje, part of the Ottoman Empire at the time. At the age of 18, she moved to Ireland and then to India, 
            where she lived most of her life. On 4 September 2016, she was canonised as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. The anniversary of her death, 5 September, 
            is her feast day.
            <br>
            &ensp; Mother Teresa founded Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation, which grew to have over 4,500 nuns across 133 countries as of 2012. 
            The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, 
            dispensaries, mobile clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take vows of chastity, 
            poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free service to the poorest of the poor."
            <br>
            &ensp; Mother Teresa received several honours, including the 1962 Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize and the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. A controversial figure 
            during her life and after her death, Mother Teresa was admired by many for her charitable work, but was criticised for her views on abortion and 
            contraception, as well as the poor conditions in her houses for the dying. Her authorised biography, written by Navin Chawla, was published in 1992, 
            and she has been the subject of many other works. On 6 September 2017, Mother Teresa and Saint Francis Xavier were named co-patrons of the Roman 
            Catholic Archdiocese of Calcutta.
